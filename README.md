As a language-agnostic software engineer, I am not constrained by any given programming language. While I have advanced knowledge of JavaScript and Python, a solid understanding of the common structures within programming languages has enabled me to quickly learn new languages and apply them to my projects. 

When it comes to programming, I believe in functionalism and a minimalist approach to generate elegant solutions. I believe digital systems should be like Lego, comprised of functional, independent, modular blocks operating together to create something greater than the sum of its parts. 

I adopted this approach while at Quillsoft Ltd., where I developed Google based accessibility tools for the education sector. The Chrome environment could change drastically with each update, and with many teachers across the world relying on these products to help a variety of disabled students learn, limiting any loss of functionality became crucial. This approach to digital system implementation allowed me to rapidly integrate changes to the system, enabling a rapid response to an ever evolving digital environment.

While I understand the important of frameworks, my curiosity has never really allowed me to accept the phrase “it just works”. Instead, I enjoy peaking under the hoods of the frameworks to learn how and why they work. This affords me a greater understanding of the frameworks themselves and enables me to utilize them more effectively.

For example, I only have a year and half experience with ReactJS, I do have experience with the Virtual DOM concept that provides the framework with superior rendering speed in the browser. When I was learning ReactJS, I realized that I had actually implemented a system to update the browser’s DOM only when required, building the actual DOM elements in memory before adding them to the document; which is the driving force behind the ReactJS render engine. 

Finally, I believe that learning is a constant process and am always looking to expand my knowledge. While in isolation, I am been satisfying my curiousity while a variety of programming projects, including [Data Structure implementations](https://github.com/lorkaan/datastruct), [Command Line automation](https://github.com/lorkaan/pexpectparser), [Web Spidering](https://github.com/lorkaan/pysider) and [Natural Language Analysis](https://github.com/topictagger).
